# Food Delivery App Interview Questions and Answers

This document provides a comprehensive set of interview questions and answers based on the full-stack food delivery application project. The project includes a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB, a React frontend for users, and a React admin panel.

## Project Overview

### Q1: What is the overall architecture of this food delivery application?
**Answer:** This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application with three main components:
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server handling API endpoints, authentication, and business logic
- **Frontend**: React application for end-users to browse food, manage cart, and place orders
- **Admin Panel**: React application for administrators to manage food items, view orders, and oversee operations
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for data persistence

### Q2: What are the key features of this food delivery app?
**Answer:** The main features include:
- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- Food item management (CRUD operations)
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order placement and tracking
- Payment processing via Stripe
- Admin dashboard for managing food items and orders
- Image upload for food items
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Q3: What technologies are used in the backend?
**Answer:** The backend uses:
- Node.js with Express.js framework
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Multer for file uploads
- Stripe for payment processing
- CORS for cross-origin requests
- Cookie-parser for handling cookies

## Backend Architecture

### Q4: How is the backend structured?
**Answer:** The backend follows a modular structure:
- `server.js`: Main entry point with middleware setup and route registration
- `config/db.js`: Database connection configuration
- `models/`: Mongoose schemas (userModel.js, foodmodel.js, orderModel.js)
- `controllers/`: Business logic (userController.js, foodController.js, cartController.js, orderController.js)
- `routes/`: API route definitions
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware like authentication
- `JWT/`: JWT token utilities
- `uploads/`: Static file storage for images

### Q5: Explain the authentication flow in this application.
**Answer:** The authentication uses JWT tokens:
1. User registers/logs in via `/api/user/register` or `/api/user/login`
2. Server validates credentials, generates JWT token
3. Token is sent in response and stored in cookies
4. Subsequent requests include the token in Authorization header
5. `authorize.js` middleware verifies the token on protected routes
6. Token contains user ID and expires after a set time

### Q6: How are food items managed in the backend?
**Answer:** Food management includes:
- **Add Food**: POST `/api/food/add` - Uploads image via multer, saves to MongoDB
- **List Food**: GET `/api/food/list` - Retrieves all food items
- **Remove Food**: POST `/api/food/remove` - Deletes food item by ID
- Images are stored in `uploads/` directory and served statically via `/images` route

### Q7: Describe the cart functionality implementation.
**Answer:** Cart operations are handled via:
- **Add to Cart**: POST `/api/cart/add` - Adds item to user's cart (requires auth)
- **Get Cart**: POST `/api/cart/get` - Retrieves user's cart items
- **Remove from Cart**: POST `/api/cart/remove` - Removes item from cart
- Cart data is stored in user document in MongoDB as an object with item IDs and quantities

### Q8: How are orders processed?
**Answer:** Order flow:
1. User places order via POST `/api/order/place`
2. Order data includes items, amount, address
3. Payment is processed via Stripe
4. Order is saved to MongoDB with status "Food Processing"
5. Admin can update order status via PUT `/api/order/status`
6. User can view orders via POST `/api/order/userorders`

### Q9: How is payment integration handled?
**Answer:** Payment uses Stripe:
- Frontend collects payment details
- Stripe processes payment on backend
- Order is created only after successful payment
- Stripe webhook can be used for payment confirmation (though not implemented in this basic version)

## Frontend Architecture

### Q10: What is the structure of the React frontend?
**Answer:** The frontend uses:
- React with Vite as build tool
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- React Toastify for notifications
- Context API for state management (StoreContext)
- Components: Header, Navbar, FoodDisplay, Cart, etc.
- Pages: Home, Cart, PlaceOrder, Verify, MyOrders

### Q11: How is state management handled in the frontend?
**Answer:** Uses React Context API:
- `StoreContext` provides global state for cart, food list, user token
- Context includes functions for adding/removing cart items, calculating totals
- Components consume context via `useContext` hook

### Q12: Explain the food display and ordering flow.
**Answer:** 
1. `FoodDisplay` component shows food items by category
2. `FoodItem` component allows adding to cart
3. Cart page shows selected items with quantity controls
4. `PlaceOrder` page collects delivery address
5. Payment is handled via Stripe integration
6. `Verify` page confirms order placement

### Q13: How is user authentication handled on the frontend?
**Answer:** 
- `LoginPop` component for login/signup modal
- Token stored in localStorage after login
- Axios interceptors add token to API requests
- Protected routes check for token presence

## Admin Panel

### Q14: What functionality does the admin panel provide?
**Answer:** Admin features:
- Add new food items with image upload
- View and remove existing food items
- View all orders with status updates
- Dashboard with overview statistics
- Authentication for admin access

### Q15: How is the admin panel structured?
**Answer:** Similar to frontend but with admin-specific components:
- `Navbar` and `Sidebar` for navigation
- `Add` page for food item creation
- `List` page for food item management
- `Orders` page for order management
- Uses same authentication system as user frontend

## Database Design

### Q16: What are the main database models?
**Answer:** Three main models:
- **User Model**: name, email, password, cart (object with food IDs and quantities)
- **Food Model**: name, description, price, category, image
- **Order Model**: userId, items (array), amount, address, status, payment status

### Q17: How is data validation handled?
**Answer:** Uses Joi for input validation:
- User registration/login data validation
- Food item data validation
- Order data validation
- Prevents invalid data from entering the database

## Security

### Q18: What security measures are implemented?
**Answer:** 
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT authentication with expiration
- CORS configuration for allowed origins
- Input validation with Joi
- Cookie-based token storage
- Protected routes with middleware

### Q19: How are images handled securely?
**Answer:** 
- Multer handles file uploads with size limits
- Files stored in `uploads/` directory
- Static file serving with Express
- File type validation (though basic in this implementation)

## API Design

### Q20: What are the main API endpoints?
**Answer:** 
- **User**: `/api/user/register`, `/api/user/login`, `/api/user/logout`
- **Food**: `/api/food/add`, `/api/food/list`, `/api/food/remove`
- **Cart**: `/api/cart/add`, `/api/cart/get`, `/api/cart/remove`
- **Order**: `/api/order/place`, `/api/order/userorders`, `/api/order/status`

### Q21: How is error handling done in the APIs?
**Answer:** 
- Try-catch blocks in controllers
- Consistent error response format
- HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 500)
- Error messages sent to frontend for user feedback
